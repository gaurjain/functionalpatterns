            Executor service with 'Cached thread pool' type
            instantiate a thread pool that creates new threads as needed,
            but reuse previously constructed threads when available.
            Here the thread-pool executor is defined with
            corePoolSize:0, maxPoolSize:Integer.MAX_VALUE, keepAliveTime:60 Sec,
            and workQueue: SynchronousQueue<Runnable>, which can
            only hold one task at a time.
            It is not really a queue but rather a data structure.
            The cached pools will typically improve the performance
            of programs that execute many short-lived asynchronous tasks.
            Every time a task is submitted,
            the pool will hold this task in the sync queue and
            search for an idle thread for assignment.
            At a given time, If all threads are busy,
            then it creates a new thread and place it in the pool
            and assign it the task.
            Executor service kills threads that are idle for more than 60 seconds.
